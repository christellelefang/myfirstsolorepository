    <h1>The very first classes</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Arlette Lefang. I'm learning web development. I started the class with lots of questions. Would I be able to understand or do well in this new course? My doubt came mostly from the fact that I have no solid foundation in IT. Today, I have to admit that I am actually liking it so far even though I need more time to make sense of what it is all about. I have started to understand what Gib bash is or gibhub and realize that understanding a concept/new discipline requires dedication and practice to excel.</p>
